1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
---> In Excel, the dollar sign ($) is used to create an absolute cell reference or an absolute range reference.
 When you place a dollar sign before the column letter or row number in a cell reference, it indicates that the 
column letter or row number should not change when the formula is copied to other cells.

For example:

 $A$1: This is an absolute cell reference. Both the column letter (A) and the row number (1) are fixed. If you copy the 
      formula containing this reference to other cells, it will always refer to cell A1.
 $A1: This is a mixed cell reference where only the column letter is absolute. If you copy the formula containing this 
     reference across columns, the column letter (A) will remain fixed, but the row number will change.
 A$1: This is another mixed cell reference where only the row number is absolute. If you copy the formula containing this
    reference down rows, the row number (1) will remain fixed, but the column letter will change.
In summary, the dollar sign ($) in Excel is used to anchor specific parts of a cell reference (either the column letter,
 row number, or both) to prevent them from changing when the formula is copied to other cells.


2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
---> To change a cell reference from relative to absolute (or mixed) in Excel:
.Select the cell reference in the formula.
.Press the F4 key to toggle between relative, absolute, and mixed references.


3. Explain the order of operations in excel?
---> In Excel, the order of operations follows the acronym PEMDAS:
 Parentheses: Excel evaluates expressions inside parentheses first.
 Exponents: Excel calculates exponentiation (raising a number to a power) next.
 Multiplication and Division: Excel performs multiplication and division from left to right.
 Addition and Subtraction: Excel adds and subtracts from left to right.
 This order ensures that formulas are calculated correctly according to mathematical rules.


4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax
for any of two?
---> The top 5 functions in Excel, based on their frequent usage and versatility, are:

 SUM: Adds up all the numbers in a range.
 Syntax: =SUM(number1, [number2], ...)

 IF: Performs a conditional test and returns one value if the condition is true and another value if the condition 
 is false.
 Syntax: =IF(logical_test, value_if_true, [value_if_false])

 VLOOKUP: Searches for a value in the first column of a table array and returns a value in the same row from another 
 column (vertical lookup).
 Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

 CONCATENATE: Joins several text strings into one string.
 Syntax: =CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...)

 AVERAGE: Calculates the average of numbers in a range.
 Syntax: =AVERAGE(number1, [number2], ...)


5. When would you use the subtotal function?
---> You would use the SUBTOTAL function in Excel when you want to perform calculations on a range of data while
  excluding other SUBTOTAL and manually hidden rows. It's commonly used for calculations in filtered data sets
  or when working with subtotal rows in structured data.


6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
---> 
 Syntax : =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
 lookup_value: This is the value you want to search for in the first column of the table_array. It can be a value,
  reference, or a cell reference.

 table_array: This is the table of data in which you want to perform the lookup. It must include the column from which
  you want to return a value, and it can be a range reference or an array.

 col_index_num: This is the column number in the table_array from which you want to retrieve the value. The first column
  in the table_array is numbered as 1, the second column as 2, and so on.

 range_lookup (optional): This parameter specifies whether you want an exact match or an approximate match. If TRUE or
  omitted, VLOOKUP will search for the closest match (an approximate match). If FALSE, VLOOKUP will only return an exact
  match.
