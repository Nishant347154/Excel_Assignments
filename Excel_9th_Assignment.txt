1. What are the different margins options and do we adjust the margins of
the excel worksheet?
--->In Excel, the different margin options include:
. Top Margin
. Bottom Margin

 Yes, we can adjust the margins of an Excel worksheet by going to the Page Layout tab, clicking on the Margins drop-down
 menu, and selecting Custom Margins. From there, we can specify the desired margin values for each option.

2. Set a background for your table created.
---> To set a background for a table in Excel:
. Select the table.
. Go to the "Page Layout" tab.
. Click on "Background" in the "Page Setup" group.
. Choose the desired background color or image.
 Alternatively, you can also right-click on the table, select "Format Cells," go to the "Fill" tab, and choose
 a background color.


3. What is freeze panes and why do we use freeze panes? Give
examples.
---> Freeze panes is a feature in Excel used to keep specific rows or columns visible while scrolling through large
  sets of data. We use freeze panes to ensure that important headers or labels remain visible at all times, providing
  context and reference points while navigating through the spreadsheet.

 For example:
 If you have a large dataset with column headers at the top, you can freeze the top row to keep those headers visible
 while scrolling down.
 Similarly, if you have a table with row headers on the left, you can freeze the leftmost column to keep those row labels
 visible while scrolling horizontally.




4. What are the different features available within the Freeze Panes
command?
---> The Freeze Panes command in Excel allows you to freeze specific rows or columns to keep them visible while scrolling
  through large datasets. It includes options to freeze the top row, first column, or a specific row and column.
