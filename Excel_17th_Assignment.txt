1. What are modules in VBA and describe in detail the importance of
creating a module?
---> Creating modules in VBA is important because it helps organize code into manageable units, promotes reuse of code, 
   improves readability and maintainability, facilitates encapsulation for better control over access to code, and can
   lead to better performance by breaking down complex procedures into smaller, optimized chunks.


2. What is Class Module and what is the difference between a Class
Module and a Module?
---> A class module in VBA defines the blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors,
  enabling object-oriented programming. A standard module, on the other hand, contains general-purpose code not associated
  with any specific object.


3. What are Procedures? What is a Function Procedure and a Property
Procedure?
---> Procedures in VBA are code blocks that execute specific tasks. Function procedures return a value after performing 
  calculations or operations. Sub procedures do not return values and are used for executing actions or tasks. Property
   procedures are used to control the access or modification of object properties, ensuring data encapsulation and 
  controlled behavior.


4. What are Procedures? What is a Function Procedure and a Property
Procedure?
---> Procedures in VBA are code segments that execute specific tasks. Function procedures return values after performing 
   calculations or operations, useful for computing results. Sub procedures don't return values, used for executing 
   actions or tasks. Property procedures control access to object properties, allowing manipulation according to
   predefined rules. They encapsulate data and ensure controlled behavior within objects. 


5. What is a sub procedure and what are all the parts of a sub procedure
and when are they used?
---> A sub procedure in VBA is a block of code that performs a specific task and does not return a value. It consists of a 
   name, optional parameters, a declaration, a body containing the code to execute, and an optional return statement. 
   Sub procedures are used when you need to execute actions, such as updating data, displaying messages, or calling other 
    procedures, without returning a value.


6. How do you add comments in a VBA code? How do you add multiple
lines of comments in a VBA code?
---> In VBA, you can add comments using the apostrophe (') symbol. For single-line comments, simply start the line with 
   an apostrophe. To add multiple lines of comments, you can either use the apostrophe at the beginning of each line 
   or enclose the block of comments between Rem and End Rem statements.
